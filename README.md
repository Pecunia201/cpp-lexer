# Lexer.cpp

This file contains the implementation of a simple lexer for a programming language. The lexer is responsible for converting source code into meaningful tokens.

## Usage

To use this lexer, simply call the `tokenize` function with your source code in `example.txt`. The function will return a vector of `Token` matching any of the predefined `TokenType`.

## Credits

This is my own C++ implementation inspired by Tyler Laceby's "How To Build A Programming Language From Scratch" tutorial originally written for TypeScript. You can find the tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VB5TY1sIRo).
